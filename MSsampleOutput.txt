The output is just a line for each row of the magic square. The number for each "cell" in a row is printed in four spaces right justified.

For example here is one of the solutions for n = 3. The numbers 1234 are above what would actually be printed to indicate to you the position on the line where the numbers in the solution would be placed
and are not part of what is actually printed.
