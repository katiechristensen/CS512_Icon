# Icon Program to Compute Normal Magic Squares

### CSCI 512 - Design and Implementation of Computer Programming Languages

Katie Christensen, Winter 2023

This program computes normal magic squares. These are squares in which all the rows, column, and the two main diagonals sum to the same value; the “magic constant.”

This program utilizes a coexpression for each row of the square. The order (n) of the magic square will be
given as a command line parameter.

For a magic square of order n the magic constant is $n (n^2 + 1)/2$

For normal magic squares of order n = 3,4,5,6,7 and 8, the magic constants are, respectively:

15,34,65,11,175,260.

The magic square of order one is simply the number 1. There is no magic square of order 2. For n > 2 there exists a magic square.
